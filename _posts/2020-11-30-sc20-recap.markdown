description: Highlights and Videos for SC20 and the Students@SC Program

---

SC20 was an incredible conference with a lot going on! I was extremely fortunate to be the Students@SC Chair this year which was an exciting challenge. Switching an in-person program for hundreds of students was certainly a heavy lift, but it was a great experience and the entire Students@SC team did an astounding job pulling everything together and pivoting every single part of the program from Student Volunteers, to the **Virtual SCC**, to an all-virtual [Students@SC Alumni Networking Session](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyZk_jpQ4X_pRog7LQW7IKg1PoWi8_nhs).

If you missed out SC20 Student@SC Program, you can catch some of the best content on the [SC YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SCconferenceseries)!

Here are some videos where I was invited to speak in a panel or share my own video:
