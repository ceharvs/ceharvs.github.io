During 2020, I had the privilege of chairing the SC Steering Task Force on Racial and Ethnic Diversity and Inclusion. This team did many things for the conference which will hopefully continue to be shared, but the first big outcome is this [Statement on Racial and Ethnic Diversity and Inclusion](https://supercomputing.org/diversity-inclusion/).
