# Abstract

transplant2mongo allows users to transform Standard Transplant Analysis and Research (STAR) ASCII data files from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) into a MongoDB database [1, 2]. The STAR data are a complex collection of tab-separated files with inter-related records that are not amenable to complex queries. A researcher planning to use OPTN STAR data can use transplant2mongo to convert the data into a MongoDB database and then use open-source tool software for analysis. The source code for transplant2mongo is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/ceharvs/transplant2mongo](https://github.com/ceharvs/transplant2mongo) and includes sample data files for initial testing and queries.
