description: Volunteering with The Accessible World Conference
---

One of my early projects at MITRE resulted in a Tech Transfer to Simudyne and now has a nice feature in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-way-to-spot-the-next-financial-crisis-11545131907" target="blank"> Wall Street Journal</a>.

I’m happy to share with everyone that I’ll be volunteering to help out with The Accessible World Conference and evoHaX Hackathon this April in Philadelphia!
