description: Reflections on my third year in office as SIGHPC Chair. 

---

My third full year as [SIGHPC](https://www.sighpc.org/) Chair will wrap-up in June of 2025.  Since we've had some exciting changes this year, I wanted to get a post out early and will update as the ongoing ACM FY evolves.  For anyone unfamiliar with SIHGPC, it is ACM's Special Interest Group on High Performance Computing.
