My second full year as [SIGHPC](https://www.sighpc.org/) Chair came to a close in June of 2024.  For anyone unfamiliar with SIHGPC, it is ACM's Special Interest Group on High Performance Computing.

# About SIGHPC

SIGHPC's mission is to promote the advancement of the field of High Performance Computing by:

* serving as a source of information about the field to other parts of ACM and the larger scientific community.

ACM/SIGHPC co-sponsors conferences including:
* [SC Conference](https://supercomputing.org/)

# The Past Year for SIGHPC (July 2023-June 2024)

The past year for SIGHPC has brought a lot of exciting changes as well as continuations of our great work.  A few of my highlights include:
* Extending the SIGHPC Fellowship Program for another year an honoring six additional [awardees at SC23](https://www.sighpc.org/opportunities/fellowships/2023-fellowship-winners). For the SC24 class, we've approved two additional winners.
* Kicking off the [PASC ACM Student Research Competition](https://pasc24.pasc-conference.org/submission/guidelines-for-acm-student-research-competition/) and funding multiple stufents to attend PASC and share their research.
* Continued funding for the [SC ACM Student Research Competition](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/program/posters/acm-student-research-competition/).
* Continuing the [HPC Immersion Program](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/students/hpc-immersion/) through SC23 and approvals are in place for the SC24 iteration of the program.
* Honoring the Dissertation and EWLTC winners at SC23.
* Extending our [travel grant](https://www.sighpc.org/opportunities/travel-grants) program to standardize across all conferences with set rates. 
* Sponsoring the CRA-WP program in San Francisco and getting to attend in-person to speak with many young women about SIGHPC. 
* Meeting our awardees in-person at SC23 and engaging with everyone during networking sessions to get our student and awardee groups to connect.
* Hosting BoFs at SC and ISC on the benefits of our professional communities. 
* The addition of the new [Computing Continuum](https://sighpc-continuum.acm.org/) virtual chapter.
