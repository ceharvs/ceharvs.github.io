The Office of Financial Research recently released a working research paper on Agent Based Modeling for Financial Vulnerability.

[The full paper is available on the Officeâ€™s research website.](http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/ofr/research/Documents/OFRwp2014-05_BookstaberPaddrikTivnan_Agent-basedModelforFinancialVulnerability_revised.pdf)

My contributions to this paper include work on the design of experiments and large-scale simulation runs.
