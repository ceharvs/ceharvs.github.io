# Well hello there!

Thank you for taking the time to visit my online portfolio. Here you will find my resume, contact information, portfolio, and news items.

I completed my Bachelor's and Masterâ€™s of Science in Computational Science at the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey in 2011 and 2013, respectively. In December 2019, I graduated from George Mason University with my PhD in Computational Science and Informatics.  My dissertation, titled "Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis of the US Organ Transplant System", is available on [ProQuest](https://search.proquest.com/openview/14175fa4f9aa14647988e54c7b0c5f72/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y).

Currently, I work for The MITRE Corporation as a Lead High Performance and Analytic Computing Engineer where I manage the corporate High Performance Computing (HPC) service. In this role, I manage a small team of systems administrators, application specalists, and interns to provide, maintain, and educate employees on the HPC clusters. Additionally, I lead data collection and analysis efforts for the Simulation Experiment (SIMEX) Program and for various other projects at MITRE.
