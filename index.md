Thank you for taking the time to visit my online portfolio. Here you will find my resume, contact information, portfolio, and news items.

I completed my Master’s of Science in Computational Science at the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey. Stockton College offers a 4+1 program which allows students to get both their Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees in five years. I have come up through this program and completed my second degree in May 2013. My main research focuses include mathematical modeling and simulation and high performance computing.

I now work for The MITRE Corporation in McLean, Virginia as a Lead High Performance and Analytic Computing Engineer and enjoy living in the DC Metro area.  In addition to my career, I am also a PhD Candidate at George Mason University in the Computational Sciences and Informatics program.
