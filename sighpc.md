# SIGHPC Chair 2025-2028

## Candidate Statement









**<a href="https://sc25.supercomputing.org/students/" target="blank">Student programs at SC</a>**

It is both an honor and a privilege to be considered for a second term as your SIGHPC Chair. SIGHPC is a cornerstone of the HPC community, and I appreciate this incredible opportunity. 
 
Since 2017, I have served the SIGHPC community in roles including membership coordinator, Treasurer, and Chair. In these positions, I have worked with the SIGâ€™s Executive Committee to develop and fund our **<a href="https://www.sighpc.org/opportunities/fellowships" target="blank">fellowship</a>** program, create the **<a href="https://www.sighpc.org/opportunities/dissertation-award" target="blank">disertation award</a>**, expand **<a href="https://www.sighpc.org/opportunities/travel-grants" target="blank">travel grant programs</a>**, transition the **<a href="https://www.sighpc.org/opportunities/emerging-woman-leader-in-technical-computing-award" target="blank">EWLTC award</a>** to be awarded annually, improve active engagements with conferences, and add two sponsored conferences to our portfolio. I personally drove the founding of the **<a href="https://www.sighpc.org/opportunities/hpc-immersion" target="blank">HPC Immersion Program</a>**, the addition of the PASC ACM SRC, and multiple community-building events at SC.
 
With my extensive volunteer experience with the SIGHPC community and professional experience in both government and industry, I bring a broad perspective and deep motivation to this role. I plan to expand our reach into the community over the next three years with the addition of a formal mentoring program and the continued development of programs that benefit all members, from students to late-career professionals.
