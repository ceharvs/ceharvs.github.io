# Experience

**Lead High Performance and Analytic Computing Engineer**, June 2016 - Present 
The MITRE Corporation, McLean, VA

*High Performance Computing at MITRE*
* Service Manager for MITRE’s High Performance Computing (HPC) technologies within Corporate Operations. This role involves running the systems, planning purchasing and investments, and providing all user training and support.
* Provide cluster maintenance including performing installations and updates to the systems as well as monitoring and maintaining the health and status of the clusters and resource managers.
* Train all users of the HPC systems to use the systems knowledgeably and responsibly. Provide knowledge and expertise to users to help parallelize code and run applications and software on high performance computing systems.
* Manage the team running the production HPC systems including a yearly summer cohort of interns and part-time employees.

*Data Collection Lead for SIMEX*
* Coordinate and manage the data collection and analysis plan for the simulation experiment (SIMEX) including SIMEX 17-3, SIMEX 18-1, SIMEX 18-3, and SIMEX 19-2. These experiments have been for various government sponsors including the US Navy, US Army, Air Forces Central Command, Army Central Command, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the North American Aerospace Defense Command in classified and unclassified simulation experiments covering topics ranging from submarine communications to Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS).
* Lead the team of analysts and developers to preform the data collection and subsequent analysis of the data for a final report to the sponsors.
* Coordinate the entire experiment design process including designing the experiment, collaborating with the sponsors, collecting data for the experiment, performing the analysis, and authoring the final report.

*MITRE Organizer of the Federal Big Data Summit*
* Create and managed teams of leads for the MITRE-ATARC Big Data Summit Collaboration Sessions. Teams consisted of four to five senior leaders from government, industry, and MITRE.
* Co-authored and edited the Summit’s white paper for the June 2015 and the December 2015-2017 Federal Big Data Summit, along with the leads from MITRE.

**Senior Simulation and Modeling Engineer**, May 2015 - June 2016 
The MITRE Corporation, McLean, VA

*Analysis of the Organ Transplant System*
* Served as Principal investigator of an Early Career Research Program (ECRP) project sponsored by the MITRE Innovation Program to perform data analysis of the organ transplant system.
* Lead small teams on performing cost analysis and outcomes research for the Organ Transplant system in the United States in coordination with data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).
* Developed a toolkit for easily viewing and performing analysis on the data on the transplant system, obtained from UNOS. This toolkit is intended for public release.


*The MITRE Elastic Goal-Directed Simulation Framework (MEG)*
* Collaborated on MITRE’s High Performance Computing infrastructures and assisted in coordinating the updates and release of the latest version of the MITRE Elastic Goal-Directed Simulation Framework (MEG), MEG 3.0.
* Organized the transition process for models to run on the MEG infrastructure.
* Developed models and design of experiments for MEG 3.0.

*Office of Financial Research - Agent Based Modeling*
* Led the technical development of the detailed architecture to be transitioned to the Office of Financial Research.
* Coordinated and organized the development of the companion visualization system, Gyre, with the visualization team on the project.
* Continued to manage the entire pipeline from serial model updates to visualization of large-scale parallel executions, as well as the large-scale visualization process now in place.
* Responsible for organizing and running the live demonstrations given to sponsors for the work on this project.
